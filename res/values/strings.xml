    <string name="twelve_steps">The 12 Steps</string>
    <string name="step_one">1. We admitted that we were powerless over our addiction, that
    our lives had become unmanageable.</string>
    <string name="step_two">2. We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves
    could restore us to sanity.</string>
    <string name="step_three">3. We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
    care of God as we understood Him.</string>
    <string name="step_four">4. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of
    ourselves.</string>
    <string name="step_five">5. We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human
    being the exact nature of our wrongs.</string>
    <string name="step_six">6. We were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects
    of character.</string>
    <string name="step_seven">7. We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</string>
    <string name="step_eight">8. We made a list of all persons we had harmed and became
    willing to make amends to them all.</string>
    <string name="step_nine">9. We made direct amends to such people wherever possible,
    except when to do so would injure them or others.</string>
    <string name="step_ten">10. We continued to take personal inventory and when we were
    wrong promptly admitted it.</string>
    <string name="step_eleven">11. We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
    conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying
    only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry
    that out.</string>
    <string name="step_twelve">12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps,
    we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice
    these principles in all our affairs.</string>
