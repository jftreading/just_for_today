            <li>1. We admitted that we were powerless over our addiction, that
                our lives had become unmanageable.</li>
            <li>2. We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves
                could restore us to sanity.</li>
            <li>3. We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the
                care of God as we understood Him.</li>
            <li>4. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of
                ourselves.</li>
            <li>5. We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human
                being the exact nature of our wrongs.</li>
            <li>6. We were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects
                of character.</li>
            <li>7. We humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
            <li>8. We made a list of all persons we had harmed and became
                willing to make amends to them all.</li>
            <li>9. We made direct amends to such people wherever possible,
                except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
            <li>10. We continued to take personal inventory and when we were
                wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
            <li>11. We sought through prayer and meditation to improve our
                conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying
                only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry
                that out.</li>
            <li>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps,
                we tried to carry this message to addicts, and to practice
                these principles in all our affairs.</li>
